# Task

- Exercise 04 - Adding an event listener to an element
- Exercise 05 - Removing the v-model directive from the input

## What I learned?

- How to create custom events and how to emit them.
- V-modal automatically declares the bind. While the :value can be a variable, a method, a computed property, or a Vuex getter, etc. In terms of the event listener, it can be a function or a direct declaration of a variable assignment.
